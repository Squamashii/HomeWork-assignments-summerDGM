//A list is basically a dynamic array. A collection of items that is editable in the game engine during game play, and anywhere inside C#. Arrays are not editable after you declare them, unless you make them public. But Lists are editable everywhere.
//In order to use a list, you must first declare at the beggining of your script that you want to use the generic collections system:

using System.Collections.Generic;

//here is a basic list syntax

public List<Class> listName = new List<Class>();
listName.Add(NewItem);

//We are declaring that the list is public, so we can edit it in Unity.
//Next you declare the data type/class in <T> brackets.
//Class is the collection that the list is going to allow into the spots. So, this could be int, string, or a class that you created. 
//You can only add items of that type or class into the list. Here are soe examples:

public List<int> myIntegers = new List<int>();

public List<GameObject> myObjects = new List<GameObject>();

public List<string> myStrings = new List<string>();

//To get the number of items in your list, you can use the command: listName.Count
//To populate items on the list, use the listName.Add(new item); command

public List<string> animals = new List<string>();
animals.Add("Gecko");   //Spot 0
animals.Add("Quail");   //Spot 1
animals.Add("Beaver");  //Spot 2.. etc
animals.Add("Raven");
animals.Add("Lynx");

//You can replace items in a list my calling the index number. Remember counting starts at 0
animals[2] = ("Shark");   //This will replace Beaver with a Shark. Beaver is in the 2 spot.
