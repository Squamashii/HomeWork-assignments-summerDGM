A function is a segment of the code that performs an action based on the information you give it. 
The syntax for a function using parameters is exactly the same as the last functions we did, except you put values and declare the variable types in the argument.
Here is the basic break down of the syntax:

Public void FunctionName(arg1VarType arg1VarName, arg2VarType arg2VarName, etc){
  <actions>;
  }

So lets say that we want to make a roller coaster function based on how many seats are filled on each row.
Lets make a variable for each of the 6 rows of 4 people.
Here is my roller coaster function skeleton:

  Public void RollerCoaster(int Row1, int Row2, int Row3, int Row4, int Row5, int Row6){
    //Based on how many people there are, we could have the roller coaster do different things here..
    }

To call our roller coaster, it would look something like the following:

  RollerCoaster(2, 4, 2, 3, 4, 4);


In the toaster example, we have a function
that uses parameters (slot1 and slot2). These 2 parameters are of the type INT, and therefore, later on when we call the function, 
all we need to do is fill in those two spots in the argument field with integers. Then the function will perform actions based on those 2 inputs.
You can have as many parameters as you want, but theymust all be of the same type.
In this example, the function is called "Toaster" and when we call the function, we would say "Toaster(Slot1, Slot2);" OR Toaster(5,7);

 
 
 void Toaster(int slot1, int slot2){
        if(slot1 == 1 || slot2 == 1){
            print("Bread is toasted!");
        }
        else if(slot1 == 1 && slot2 == 1){
            print("Both slices are toasted!");
        }
        else{
            print("Something went wrong!");
        }
    }
    Toaster(1,0);
}
