/*
Functions are a block of code that fulfills an order. They do things. Otherwise it is just code. Functions are the machines within the code that get it to do things.

Void functions are used whenever you don't need a value returned. They simply obey your command.
For example, say you have a character that shoots arrows. You would use a function that carries out the shoot action every time you click the trigger button.

basic syntax of a funtion:

void FunctionName(arguments){
  <Actions>
}
//Then later you can call the function with inputs in the argument fields, and it will carry it out.


void Toaster(int slot1, int slot2){ //between”()” is called the argument. These 2 slots are temporary variables
		if(slot1 == 1 || slot2 == 1){ //Here we are checking to see if the two variables meet certain parameters, if so, we carry out the action of the if statement
			print("Bread is toasted!");
		}
		else if(slot1 == 1 && slot2 == 1){
			print("Both slices are toasted!");
		}
		else{
			print("Something went wrong!");
		}
	}
	
  Toaster(1,0); //This is where the variables are used.. when you call the function down here, (1,0) is in plaace of (slot1, slot2).
  
  public int num1;  //These are public variables that we can change, and then the funtion will add them together.
	public int num2;

	void Start(){
		int num = AddNumbers(num1,num2);
		print (num);
	}

	public int AddNumbers(int number1, int number2){ //Upper case name (AddNumbers) makes it a function
		int result = number1 + number2;
		return result; //This is a function where we want a returned value, so it is not a void function
	}
