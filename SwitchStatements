/*
Switch statements are a way to have different outputs depending on the input for a variable. 
IF/Else statements check to see if a value returns true, and a switch statement basically just checks your input and gives you an output.
So, the following breaks down the pieces of a switch statement:
--------------------
<Variable> = <Value>

switch(<Variable>)
{
case <input1>:
	<action>;
  break;
case <inpu2>:
	<action>;
  break;
Default:
	<action>;
  break;
}
-------------------
The switch statement is going to look at the value of the variable in the parenthesis, then it will match it with a "case" to give you the output.
If none of the cases match, then the statement will give you the default output.
You can have as many cases as you want, but each one should end with a "break;" This will tell the statement to end after the action, rather than continuing to the acctions in the following case.
The following code is examples we covered in class:
*/


class main()
{
	int selection = 1; //this is a global variable that can be accessed anywhere in the script


	void story(selection)
	{
	switch (selection)
		{
		case 1:
			print("Mary had a little lamb");
			break;
		case 2:
			print("Jack and the beanstalk");
			break;
		default:
			print("Out of luck, pal");
			break;
		}
	}

	void song(selection)
	{
	switch (selection)
		{
		case 1:
			print("Mary had a little lamb");
			break;
		case 2:
			print("Stairway to Heaven");
			break;
		default:
			print("Game Over music");
			break;
		}
	}
}


			string lightColor = "green";

			if (llightColor == "green")
			{
				print("Go, the light is green");
			}
			else if (lightColor == "yellow")
			{
				print("The light is yellow, start to stop!");
			}
			else
			{
				print("The light is red. Stop!!!");
			}

//----------Switch Statement with integers---------------------------
		public int jedi = 4;

			switch(jedi)
			{
			case 1:
				print("These are not the droids you're looking for");
			  break;
			case 2:
				print("I have a bad feeling about this");
			  break;
			case 3:
				print("Use the Force");
			  break;
			case 4:
				print("May the force be with you!");
			  break;
			default:
				print("Judgeme by my size...");
			  break;
			}
//----------Switch Statement with strings----------------------------			
			public int jedi2 = "Luke";

			switch(jedi2)
			{
			case "Ben":
				print("These are not the droids you're looking for");
			  break;
			case "Luke":
				string story			
			  break;
			case "Obiwan":
				print("Use the Force");
			  break;
			case "Anakin":
				print("May the force be with you!");
			  break;
			default:
				print("Judgeme by my size...");
			  break;
			}
	}
