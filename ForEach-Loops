//ForEach loops repeat the loop for every item in a collection or list. So, for example, if you have ten items on a list, it will complete the action one time for each item.
//Here is the basic syntax

foreach (var item in collection)
		{
			<action>;
		}

foreach: This is the loop type
var: This is a placeholder for the variable type of the collection you will be working with. If it is a list of strings, then you would replace var with string
item: This is a keyword that means the actual item on the list.
in: This literally means it will be looking IN the specified collection.
collection: This is replaced by the name of the list

List<string> animalList = new List<string>();
animalList.Add("frog");
animalList.Add("bat");
animalList.Add("llama");

void Start ()
{
foreach (string item in animalList)
	  {
			print(item);
		}
    print("There are " + animalList.Count + " animals in the game");
}

//This loop will print the name of each of the 3 items in the animalList list, and then state how many animals there are. 
//notice the 2nd print action is after the curly brackets that close the loop. If they were inside the curly brackets, then it would state the number fter every name.

//So, lets do another one:

List<int> doubleStuff = new List<int>();
doubleStuff.Add(5);
doubleStuff.Add(7);
doubleStuff.Add(13);
doubleStuff.Add(2);

void Start ()
{
foreach (int item in doubleStuff)
	  {
			print(item*2);
		}
}

//In this loop, it will find every item integer item in the doubleStuff list and print the value*2.
